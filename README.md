Want a little chibi Shigure to dance on your screen? 
This little program will put just that on your screen above everything else. You can drag her around to anywhere on your screen, and once you got her right where you want her, just press (ctrl+B). Pressing this button will lock her in place and also let you interact with any programs underneath her. Want to move her around again? Just press (ctrl+L) and she'll let you move her again
